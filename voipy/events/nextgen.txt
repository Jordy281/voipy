from voipy import events

server = events.channel('udp', listen=('0.0.0.0', 5060), handler=sip_handler)

events.run()

events.py => event engine and channel base class
channels.py => UDP, TCP, SSL and PCAP channel implementations
useragent.py => sip handler, UA, UAC, UAS

either we collect all the channel objects into one location (here) and implement our
own factory, or we have to use a factory object in the core event engine. The engine
should create new channels and register them for loop.

A Channel is an interface into network stream. It is possible to have multiple channels with just a single handler.
